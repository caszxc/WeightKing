        <p>Resistance bands have become a staple in fitness routines due to their versatility and effectiveness. Evolving from simple elastic bands, modern resistance bands offer a wealth of benefits to fitness enthusiasts at all levels.</p>
        
        <h2>What is a Resistance Band?</h2>
        <p class="highlight">A resistance band is an elastic band used for strength training and physical therapy. They come in various resistances, lengths, and sizes, and are designed to improve strength, flexibility, and coordination. Resistance bands are typically made from latex or rubber and can range from light to heavy resistance levels.</p>

        <h2>How to Use a Resistance Band</h2>
        <p>Resistance band exercises are beneficial for everyone, from athletes to those recovering from injuries. They are a powerful tool for boosting strength, overall fitness, coordination, and flexibility. This versatile equipment can be used for a wide variety of exercises, either alone or with a partner. We love that resistance bands can be used for exercises like squats, rows, and presses.</p>
