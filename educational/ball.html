Medicine balls are made of a wide range of materials, including rubber, vinyl, nylon, and leather. They may weigh anywhere from two to 25 pounds and are usually around 14 inches in diameter.</p>

        <p>Medicine ball circles may look and sound simple, but this exercise will set your shoulders on fire in no time. Make the most of this exercise by moving slowly and maintaining constant control. To perform medicine ball circles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Start with your feet shoulder-width apart while holding the medicine ball directly overhead.</li>
            <li>Breathe in and engage your core muscles.</li>
            <li>With your arms extended, draw a circle with your medicine ball in a clockwise direction.</li>   
            <li>Keep your feet in place throughout the exercise.</li>   
            <li>Your core should only twist slightly to complete the motion.</li>
            <li>Repeat this motion clockwise eight to 10 times</li>
            <li>Repeat the exercise moving counterclockwise eight to 10 times to complete one set.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Overhead squats are designed to fire up your core by challenging your stability. By adding the medicine ball for weight, you will gain the added benefit of working out your arms, shoulders, and upper back. Overhead squats require correct form and focus. To achieve an overhead squat with your medicine ball:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Start with your feet shoulder-width apart.</li>
            <li>Hold the medicine ball above your head, with your arms aligned with your ears.</li>
            <li>Engage your core.</li>   
            <li>Bend your knees and drive your hips back to squat — think about sitting in a chair.</li>   
            <li>Squat only to the point that your thighs become parallel to the floor.</li>
            <li>Be sure to keep your knees going straight over your toes, never bowing inward.</li>
            <li>Drive your heels into the floor and squeeze your glutes to return to the starting position.</li>
            <li>Repeat this 12 to 15 times to complete one set.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Slams</h3>

        <p>If you’re looking to develop strength, power, and cardio in one exercise, the medicine ball slam will do the trick. Maximize this exercise by using a heavier medicine ball. To execute an effective medicine ball slam:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Start with your feet about shoulder-width apart.</li>
            <li>Hold the medicine ball directly above your head.</li>
            <li>Engage your core.</li>   
            <li>Bend at your hips, as if to squat.</li>   
            <li>Keep your arms extended and slam the medicine ball into the ground with force.</li>
            <li>Pick up the ball and return to your starting position with the ball overhead.</li>
            <li>Repeat 10 times to complete one set.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To elevate your basic push-ups, incorporate your medicine ball. This exercise will provide you with a powerful stretch in your chest as well as added strengthening benefits. To use a medicine ball in your push up routine:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Start in a standard push-up position.</li>
            <li>Place a medicine ball underneath one hand.</li>
            <li>It’s ok to let your elbows rest in a wider position than a typical push-up, but be careful to keep your spine and neck straight.</li>   
            <li>Complete one push-up.</li>   
            <li>Switch the medicine ball to your other hand, then repeat 10 to 15 times to complete one set.</li>
        </ul>
