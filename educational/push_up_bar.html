        <h1>A Guide to Push Up Bars</h1>
        <p>Push up bars are a simple yet effective tool for enhancing your push-up workouts. They provide better wrist alignment, increased range of motion, and a more comfortable grip, allowing you to target your chest, shoulders, and triceps more effectively.</p>
        
        <h2>What are Push Up Bars?</h2>
        <p class="highlight">Push up bars are small, portable devices that you place on the floor to perform push-ups. They typically have a handle and a base, elevating your hands off the ground and allowing for a deeper push-up.</p>
        
        <h2>Benefits of Using Push Up Bars</h2>
        <li>Reduces Wrist Strain</li>
        <li>Increases Range of Motion</li>
        <li>Enhances Muscle Activation</li>
        <li>Portable and Easy to Use</li>
         
        <h2>How to Use Push Up Bars</h2>
        <p>Using push up bars is similar to performing regular push-ups. Place the bars shoulder-width apart on the floor, grip the handles, and get into a plank position. Lower your body until your chest is just above the ground, then push back up to the starting position.</p>
        <p>Here are some safety tips for using push up bars:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure the bars are stable and wonâ€™t slip during use.</li>
            <li>Keep your core engaged and back straight.</li>
            <li>Avoid locking your elbows at the top of the movement.</li>
            <li>Start with a small range of motion and gradually increase it.</li>
        </ul>
