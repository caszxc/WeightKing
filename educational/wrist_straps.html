Wrist straps should be used for heavy lifting exercises where grip strength may become a limiting factor.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Choose the right length and material of wrist straps for your needs.</li>
            <li>Ensure the wrist straps are properly tightened to prevent slipping during lifts.</li>
            <li>Avoid over-reliance on wrist straps and incorporate grip strength exercises into your routine.</li>
            <li>Replace worn-out wrist straps to maintain effectiveness.</li>
        </ul>
