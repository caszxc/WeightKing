        <h2>How to Use a Weight Lifting Belt</h2>
        <p>Using a weight lifting belt involves positioning it around your waist, just above your hips. Tighten the belt so it is snug but not restrictive, allowing you to breathe comfortably. Use the belt during heavy lifts such as squats, deadlifts, and overhead presses.</p>
        <p>Here are some safety tips for using a weight lifting belt:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure the belt is the right size for your waist.</li>
            <li>Do not overtighten the belt; it should support, not restrict.</li>
            <li>Use the belt only for heavy lifts, not for every exercise.</li>
            <li>Focus on maintaining proper form and technique.</li>
        </ul>
