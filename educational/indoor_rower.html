        <p>The indoor rower, also known as a rowing machine, provides a full-body workout that combines cardiovascular exercise with strength training. It simulates the motion of rowing a boat, engaging multiple muscle groups.</p>
        
        <h2>What is an Indoor Rower?</h2>
        <p class="highlight">An indoor rower consists of a sliding seat, footrests, and a handle attached to a resistance mechanism. As you pull the handle, the resistance simulates the feel of rowing on water.</p>

        <p>Using an indoor rower involves a sequence of movements: the catch, drive, finish, and recovery. Sit on the seat, strap your feet into the footrests, and grip the handle. Push off with your legs, pull the handle towards your chest, and then return to the starting position.</p>
        <p>Here are some safety tips for using an indoor rower:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Start with a low resistance and gradually increase it.</li>
            <li>Maintain good posture with a straight back and engaged core.</li>
            <li>Avoid locking your knees at the end of the stroke.</li>
            <li>Keep your movements smooth and controlled.</li>
        </ul>
